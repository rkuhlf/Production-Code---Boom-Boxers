# To Do

Resolve error with the failure to open file. Try commenting out the separate section that opens it. Also try without the move() section.

Try with a USB stick and see if that is more reliable.

Separate the load cell platform into a different class so that it can be used if there are three load cells and it can be used if there is only one load cell.

Debug the logging setup in a vacuum because it seems like there is memory overflow going on.
